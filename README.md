### The Near Vision
By the end of the first sprint we should have started the design of the game and getting rough idea about the number of characters needed through the game,As for the end of the second sprint we should have Started Working on the Open World of the game.

### Backlog Items
-As a User, I need the game to have a variety of characters : this will be the most important as the game will be built around the story  
-As a User, I need the game to have multiple Playable Characters : this will be Important as the game will allow the player to have different playstyles to fit every player taste  
-As a User, I need the game to have customisation for characters : every playable character will be customisable where every player can make whatever the character they like look like  
-As a User, I need the game to have a Lore Based on Marvel Universe : as the lore has a great importance the lore of the game will be researched and applied according to Marvel Universty  
-As a User, I need the game to be Open World : The game will be Open world so the player can roam freely as he feels like but this has to be late as every other aspect should be ready first  
-As a User, I need the game to have Interactive Environment : After making the Open world the game should have Interactive Enviroment so that the player will feel Imerssed in the game  
-As a User, I need the game to have Boss Fights : Designing Boss fights according to the lore and have reasonable difficulty    
-As a User, I need the game to have Multiple Weapons with different Effects : After having the game almost complete we will start working on the weapons  
-As a User, I need the game to have Multiple difficulties : the game will have multiple difficulity so that casual and compettitve players can play the game  
-As a User, I need the game to have Universal ambient Sound Effects : Finally Sound Effects will be added as the last item  
### Story Points Estimate Per Sprint
The Average Story Point per Sprint will be around 50 Which should be reasonable according to my team capabilities with Average  Stories per Sprint

### Workflow
We start at the starting point then the Story is created it is added to the To-Do and when the time comes to be worked on it is added to in-progress Sometimes there is higher priority story comes up so Story in the In-progress can be removed and re added to the To-Do and then added again into the in-progress when time is right also the story could be cancelled as some requirment have changed or if we noticed that it might not be that important anymore , when the work is finished story is moved to testing to make sure it is meeting all the acceptance criteria after the Story is tested it might be re added to the to do list if the story didnot meet the acceptance criteria , Lastly after meeting the acceptance criteria story is moved to Done state.
